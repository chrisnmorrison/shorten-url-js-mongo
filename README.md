# URL Shortener using NodeJS & MongoDB, and a lightweight HTML/CSS front-end

This application shortens the url entered by the user. It stores the URL in the database, and when identical URLS are entered, it returns the same URL to avoid duplicates.

MongoDB is a non-relational database that is very fast, and easy to use.

**Note**: This project is set up to run on your local environment, and would need to be configured to be made usable by the public.

## Setup and Use

Step 1: Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chrisnmorrison/shorten-url-js-mongo
```

Step 2: cd into the cloned repo and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Step 3: Install & Run MongoDB

If you aren't entirely familiar with MongoDB, i'd recommend using [Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass) as a desktop GUI. See Mongo Docs to learn how to set up a local environment.

Step 4: Install Nodemon (optional but recommended)

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

Step 5: Start the application

```bash
npm start
```
